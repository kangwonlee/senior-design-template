|	0:05	|	Hi, I'm James Dyson,	|		|
|	0:07	|	I'm here to answer your questions from Twitter.	|		|
|	0:10	|	This is "Design Support".	|		|
|	0:12	|	[deep rhythmic music]	|		|
|	0:16	|	So first up from @muratdemirbas, "What is the best designed,	|		|
|	0:20	|	joy to use product in your life?"	|		|
|	0:23	|	And I've got it right here	|		|
|	0:25	|	and I bought it in Japan about 30 years ago.	|		|
|	0:29	|	What makes this pencil sharpener special	|		|
|	0:31	|	and better than all the ones I've come across?	|		|
|	0:33	|	The other ones are plastic	|		|
|	0:35	|	and often when you put the pencil in,	|		|
|	0:36	|	the thing topples over.	|		|
|	0:38	|	Whereas this is made of cast aluminium so it's very heavy.	|		|
|	0:42	|	And actually it was quite heavy to carry home from the shop	|		|
|	0:44	|	and bring all the way back from Japan.	|		|
|	0:45	|	It just works very well, doesn't slip around on the table.	|		|
|	0:48	|	Looks good, has got spots to store pencils in it	|		|
|	0:51	|	and it's worked for me unfailingly for 30 years.	|		|
|	0:55	|	The joy of putting this in [motor whirring]	|		|
|	0:58	|	and coming out with a lovely, sharp end	|		|
|	1:01	|	and the noise it makes, it's just delightful.	|		|
|	1:04	|	This one's from @Rarst,	|		|
|	1:05	|	What is the worst designed appliance you own?	|		|
|	1:09	|	And that's a really easy one to answer and it's a printer.	|		|
|	1:13	|	That next question is from @DougCollinsUX,	|		|
|	1:16	|	Who are your design heroes and why?	|		|
|	1:19	|	Well, one of my design heroes	|		|
|	1:21	|	is Alec Issigonis who designed the Mini.	|		|
|	1:24	|	What I really like about the Mini,	|		|
|	1:25	|	which is also true of the Walkman,	|		|
|	1:28	|	is when they did some research	|		|
|	1:30	|	to find out whether the Mini would sell,	|		|
|	1:33	|	this tiny car only 10 foot long with tiny wheels,	|		|
|	1:36	|	the market research said it wouldn't sell.	|		|
|	1:39	|	Nobody would want a car with silly little wheels like that.	|		|
|	1:42	|	It was just too small.	|		|
|	1:44	|	Of course, ultimately,	|		|
|	1:45	|	it became one of the best selling cars in history	|		|
|	1:47	|	and was still being made 50 years later.	|		|
|	1:50	|	What I really like about that is that the car he designed	|		|
|	1:54	|	looks as good today as it did in the late 50s	|		|
|	1:57	|	and that's because it's not styled.	|		|
|	2:00	|	It's the sort of opposite of Harley Earl.	|		|
|	2:02	|	Harley Earl is the sort of designer I hate	|		|
|	2:04	|	because it's all fancy wings and it's very showy.	|		|
|	2:07	|	It's design put there to appeal to people to make it sell.	|		|
|	2:11	|	And this is another,	|		|
|	2:12	|	and the interesting thing about the Sony Walkman	|		|
|	2:14	|	is that it's a tape recorder that won't record.	|		|
|	2:18	|	And that's really, really brave	|		|
|	2:20	|	because again they went and asked people,	|		|
|	2:22	|	do you want to buy this tape recorder that doesn't record?	|		|
|	2:25	|	It just plays back.	|		|
|	2:26	|	And everybody said, no and absolute nonsense,	|		|
|	2:28	|	everybody wants a tape recorder that can record.	|		|
|	2:31	|	But Akio Morita at Sony had the bravery to see	|		|
|	2:34	|	that actually, although no one says they want it	|		|
|	2:37	|	he believed they would want it	|		|
|	2:39	|	because they could put it in their pocket	|		|
|	2:40	|	and play music with earphones,	|		|
|	2:43	|	which no one had ever really been able to do before.	|		|
|	2:46	|	The next one's quite funny. [laughs]	|		|
|	2:48	|	The next questions from @salvatoreDOTcom,	|		|
|	2:51	|	he says, "How does suction even like work?"	|		|
|	2:55	|	You create suction by developing a very highspeed airflow.	|		|
|	3:00	|	So, you have an electric motor here and a turbine here	|		|
|	3:04	|	and if you turn that very, very fast,	|		|
|	3:06	|	and we go about 130,000 RPM with that,	|		|
|	3:09	|	the air is drawn in to the center here	|		|
|	3:13	|	and spun out of the periphery of that turbine	|		|
|	3:17	|	at great speed.	|		|
|	3:19	|	And it's so fast that it draws in more and more air,	|		|
|	3:23	|	huge amounts of air, and expels them at very high speed	|		|
|	3:27	|	and if you're drawing in a lot of air into this device,	|		|
|	3:32	|	you're creating suction, so that's what suction is.	|		|
|	3:36	|	Next question is from @JoseOrtega.	|		|
|	3:38	|	Product Designers,	|		|
|	3:40	|	what was your biggest challenge to overcome,	|		|
|	3:42	|	lack of experience?	|		|
|	3:44	|	How did you overcome it?	|		|
|	3:45	|	Very interestingly	|		|
|	3:46	|	I think a lack of experience is a great help.	|		|
|	3:49	|	An expert thinks he knows it all	|		|
|	3:51	|	but he's also rather inhibited	|		|
|	3:53	|	by his experience, his knowledge,	|		|
|	3:56	|	and he finds it difficult to steer off the well-known path.	|		|
|	4:00	|	Whereas if you have a lack of experience but huge curiosity	|		|
|	4:04	|	and you approach your new challenge with naivety,	|		|
|	4:07	|	I think it's easier for you as an inexperienced designer	|		|
|	4:12	|	to come up with something different	|		|
|	4:13	|	and to follow a different path.	|		|
|	4:15	|	I'll give an example.	|		|
|	4:16	|	When I started to develop	|		|
|	4:18	|	my cyclonic vacuum cleaner separation systems,	|		|
|	4:22	|	separating dust from air, I went to the experts	|		|
|	4:25	|	and they said you'll never make a cyclone	|		|
|	4:27	|	that clears dust out of air below 20 microns.	|		|
|	4:33	|	And 20 microns is a bit too big	|		|
|	4:35	|	because a lot of dust is like cigarette smoke,	|		|
|	4:38	|	it's half a micron or 0.3 of a micron.	|		|
|	4:40	|	But because of my naivety, I thought, well, maybe he's wrong	|		|
|	4:44	|	and I'll try and make it work,	|		|
|	4:46	|	so 5 1/2 thousand prototypes later I had made it work	|		|
|	4:50	|	and I'd got it down from 20 microns down to 0.3 of a micron.	|		|
|	4:54	|	I advanced the science from being a complete novice.	|		|
|	4:58	|	From @mrs_sloperrrr,	|		|
|	4:59	|	What do I do if I have an invention idea?	|		|
|	5:03	|	The first thing you should do is build a prototype	|		|
|	5:06	|	and as soon as you have a product that works,	|		|
|	5:08	|	you should then file for a patent.	|		|
|	5:10	|	If you go and file the patent before you've made it work	|		|
|	5:14	|	you could get into trouble	|		|
|	5:15	|	because a patent has to be of a product or a technology	|		|
|	5:20	|	or an engineering idea that works	|		|
|	5:23	|	and you have to prove that it works.	|		|
|	5:25	|	And I'm sometimes asked	|		|
|	5:26	|	whether you can contract out the making of a prototype	|		|
|	5:30	|	to a development company or a model builder or something,	|		|
|	5:34	|	and indeed you can do that.	|		|
|	5:35	|	And if it's a purely visual model,	|		|
|	5:37	|	I think that's a perfectly good thing to do	|		|
|	5:40	|	but if it's anything mechanical	|		|
|	5:42	|	or something that has to work,	|		|
|	5:44	|	or has a technology that you've got to make to work,	|		|
|	5:47	|	it's much, much better you do it yourself.	|		|
|	5:49	|	Because when you come to,	|		|
|	5:51	|	and I hope you don't ever have to do it,	|		|
|	5:53	|	but you have to fight a patent action,	|		|
|	5:55	|	one of the first things	|		|
|	5:56	|	that the person you're accusing of copying will say to you,	|		|
|	5:59	|	or their lawyers will say to you,	|		|
|	6:01	|	did you build that prototype yourself?	|		|
|	6:03	|	What they'll trying and argue	|		|
|	6:04	|	is that you didn't make the invention at all,	|		|
|	6:06	|	it was the person who built the prototype	|		|
|	6:08	|	who made the invention.	|		|
|	6:09	|	I also think that the act of making it yourself,	|		|
|	6:12	|	actually physically making the prototype,	|		|
|	6:14	|	it's vital to do that yourself	|		|
|	6:16	|	so you fully understand what you're doing	|		|
|	6:19	|	and when it fails, as it probably will, as mine always do,	|		|
|	6:22	|	I understand why it's failed	|		|
|	6:24	|	and I get an idea as to how I might make it work.	|		|
|	6:28	|	The next one's from @franklagendijk.	|		|
|	6:30	|	Quick question out of curiosity,	|		|
|	6:33	|	what are your biggest challenges currently as a UX designer,	|		|
|	6:37	|	product designer or product manager owner?	|		|
|	6:40	|	The biggest challenge is speed,	|		|
|	6:42	|	getting a product done quickly.	|		|
|	6:44	|	It takes, nowadays, a lot of people.	|		|
|	6:46	|	You have to have a lot of mechanical designers	|		|
|	6:49	|	and product designers	|		|
|	6:50	|	but also you have to have a lot of fluid dynamics,	|		|
|	6:52	|	motor engineers, software people, ballistics people.	|		|
|	6:57	|	You have to have a whole host of people	|		|
|	6:58	|	you didn't have to have 20, 25 years ago.	|		|
|	7:01	|	And increasingly because other countries	|		|
|	7:04	|	are developing technology and products so quickly,	|		|
|	7:07	|	we've got to compete with that.	|		|
|	7:09	|	So, I would say our biggest single issue	|		|
|	7:12	|	is that we've got to do things quicker.	|		|
|	7:14	|	And the next question, which is a bit of a personal one,	|		|
|	7:16	|	from @anika4prez,	|		|
|	7:17	|	It's 2021 and how are hand dryers not quiet yet?	|		|
|	7:22	|	Well, I agree with you, I have great sympathy for you,	|		|
|	7:24	|	but we're dealing with airflow devices	|		|
|	7:28	|	that go at 120, 140,000 RPM.	|		|
|	7:32	|	Any fast turbine moving air is noisy. Think of jet engines.	|		|
|	7:36	|	When we are designing new generations of hand dryers	|		|
|	7:39	|	and we've just brought one out, actually,	|		|
|	7:40	|	that's much quieter	|		|
|	7:42	|	and we've dropped it down to 750 watts from 1200 watts,	|		|
|	7:46	|	so we're getting better at it	|		|
|	7:48	|	and you're quite right to complain about it.	|		|
|	7:50	|	From @Sharonica, "A bladeless fan?	|		|
|	7:53	|	This is sorcery. How does Dyson do it?"	|		|
|	7:56	|	A bladeless fan came about	|		|
|	7:58	|	because we were looking at airflow technology.	|		|
|	8:02	|	If you let out a small blade of air,	|		|
|	8:05	|	a very high speed jet of air along a particular surface,	|		|
|	8:09	|	actually a surface not unlike an aircraft wing,	|		|
|	8:12	|	we noticed that it sucked in from behind it	|		|
|	8:15	|	a lot of extra air.	|		|
|	8:17	|	And we did a circular blade, annulars we call it,	|		|
|	8:21	|	outlet of air.	|		|
|	8:22	|	Very tiny, it was only a mil and a half wide,	|		|
|	8:24	|	and we noticed	|		|
|	8:25	|	that it increased the original air flow by 20 times.	|		|
|	8:29	|	In the process the airflow was very smooth,	|		|
|	8:32	|	it wasn't interrupted or turbulent.	|		|
|	8:34	|	Whereas a fan with blades gives turbulent air	|		|
|	8:39	|	and, of course, a blade is dangerous.	|		|
|	8:42	|	Bladed fans are very difficult to clean.	|		|
|	8:44	|	They have their motor in the center of the fan,	|		|
|	8:46	|	so the fan is top heavy and it sort of slumps.	|		|
|	8:50	|	So, we put the motor at the base so the fan was very stable	|		|
|	8:55	|	and we had it rotate around its center of gravity,	|		|
|	8:58	|	so whatever position you put it in, it stayed there.	|		|
|	9:01	|	So that's really how the fan came about.	|		|
|	9:04	|	It was a very difficult product to launch	|		|
|	9:06	|	because when we showed it to people	|		|
|	9:08	|	they had no idea what it was.	|		|
|	9:10	|	They thought it was an amplifier of some sorts.	|		|
|	9:13	|	From @LydseyDYoung, "Question for 'Inventors'.	|		|
|	9:17	|	How easy have you found it	|		|
|	9:18	|	to get to your product on major retailers shelves?"	|		|
|	9:22	|	The answer to that is very simple,	|		|
|	9:23	|	it's very, very, very difficult indeed.	|		|
|	9:26	|	They don't know whether your new and different product	|		|
|	9:29	|	is going to sell.	|		|
|	9:30	|	In many cases what they'd rather do	|		|
|	9:32	|	is just have the same products they've got before	|		|
|	9:34	|	but at a cheaper price.	|		|
|	9:36	|	But nowadays we have the internet.	|		|
|	9:38	|	I would suggest that anyone who wants to approach retailers	|		|
|	9:42	|	or wants to sell a high volume of their product,	|		|
|	9:44	|	should absolutely approach retailers	|		|
|	9:47	|	but at the same time and in parallel	|		|
|	9:49	|	sell direct on the internet	|		|
|	9:51	|	because apart from anything else,	|		|
|	9:53	|	if you can prove it sells on the internet,	|		|
|	9:56	|	the major retailers would be interested in stocking it.	|		|
|	9:59	|	The next question is from @Moe_offthewall,	|		|
|	10:02	|	How can inventors peacefully carry on innovating	|		|
|	10:05	|	when filing for a patent itself costs thousands?	|		|
|	10:09	|	This is a headache.	|		|
|	10:10	|	Well, I couldn't agree more, Moe, it's a terrible headache.	|		|
|	10:13	|	An individual can't really afford to file a patent	|		|
|	10:17	|	and in particular file a patent in many countries	|		|
|	10:20	|	but the system is expensive because the examiner	|		|
|	10:24	|	has to search through patent offices all over the world,	|		|
|	10:28	|	going back many, many years	|		|
|	10:30	|	to see if there is a similar invention to yours.	|		|
|	10:33	|	But unfortunately	|		|
|	10:34	|	it's the only protection that inventors have	|		|
|	10:37	|	and it's the only system inventors have.	|		|
|	10:39	|	It's far from perfect.	|		|
|	10:41	|	It was dreamt up by Henry IV in 1485, I think it was,	|		|
|	10:45	|	and it's stayed the same for 600 years	|		|
|	10:48	|	and the 20 year life	|		|
|	10:49	|	is exactly the same as it was 600 years ago.	|		|
|	10:52	|	So, it jolly well needs an overhaul	|		|
|	10:54	|	and it's a system that's desperately unfair	|		|
|	10:57	|	for the individual inventor or the small business.	|		|
|	11:01	|	Next question's from @behoff	|		|
|	11:03	|	and it's a very interesting one,	|		|
|	11:04	|	What's the most important element of design	|		|
|	11:06	|	in your opinion?	|		|
|	11:08	|	So I'm going to give you my opinion,	|		|
|	11:09	|	which is very different to lots of other people's opinions.	|		|
|	11:12	|	When I was at the Royal College of Art being taught design,	|		|
|	11:15	|	I discovered engineering	|		|
|	11:17	|	and I couldn't understand why engineering	|		|
|	11:20	|	was separated from design.	|		|
|	11:22	|	Why did you have	|		|
|	11:23	|	a white-coated engineer in a lab developing technology	|		|
|	11:27	|	and a designer in a separate design studio	|		|
|	11:30	|	often completely unrelated	|		|
|	11:32	|	to the company developing the product or technology,	|		|
|	11:35	|	designing the product?	|		|
|	11:36	|	So, I thought design should be part of engineering,	|		|
|	11:39	|	like Alec Issigonis with his Mini.	|		|
|	11:42	|	So I see design as being everything about a product	|		|
|	11:46	|	from the technology to the engineering to the design	|		|
|	11:50	|	to how ergonomic it is, how well it performs	|		|
|	11:54	|	and how long it lasts and what materials it use	|		|
|	11:57	|	and whether it's sustainable or not.	|		|
|	11:59	|	So I see design	|		|
|	12:00	|	covering this whole broad range of disciplines	|		|
|	12:04	|	and bringing it all together in a seamless	|		|
|	12:06	|	and uninterrupted way.	|		|
|	12:08	|	Well, that's it for now.	|		|
|	12:09	|	They were really good questions,	|		|
|	12:11	|	absolutely the right questions to be answering	|		|
|	12:13	|	and look forward to next time.	|		|
|	12:15	|	Goodbye.	|		|
